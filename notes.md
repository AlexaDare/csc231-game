Use the markdown file to structure your notes/journal

Document key objects, functions, update incrementally 

When you fix a bug -> write it down! 

Read lots of code 
- recommend just the headers 



use control B to find where it is in other files 



Move : Action 
    Result perform(Eng, ent)
        ent -> move_to(get_pos() + direction)

private 
Vec direction 


Must return alternative, failure, success  

moving the person and they fail - will go again, so the monster
needs to be able to move 


when calling tile, do not call it tile without reference 

Need to know Vec, Entity, Tiles, and Tile to move around character



INclude type means you need to include a header
